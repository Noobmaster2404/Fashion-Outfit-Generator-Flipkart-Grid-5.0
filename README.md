The problem we chose to work on is Outfit Generator using GenAI.
This is just a Proof-Of-Concept.
The repository contains 3 files.
1st is the presentation in the pdf format.
2nd is a Video mp4 that is our presentation of the idea.
3rd is the prototype which is a very basic implementation of the idea and just has the essence of it. It is trained on PolyVore dataset.
This is our submission for Flipkart GRID 5.0.
